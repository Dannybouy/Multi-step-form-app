# Multi Step Form

A multi-step form written in React that is broken down into several steps, with each step containing a subset of form fields. The user is typically presented with a progress indicator that shows the current step and the total number of steps. Navigation between steps is done using buttons or links that are enabled or disabled based on the completion status of the current step
